# News-sector-prediction

Here, I have trained the keras news prediction model on my own dataset. The dataset comprises of news description and the label to which it belongs.
The train.py python file is used to train the model on news dataset. Whereas, the test.py python file is  used to test and deploy model in local host using flask app.
